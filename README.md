# Introduction

In this repository, I aim to explore the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms. By implementing these data structures and algorithms in various programming languages, I hope to solidify my understanding and improve my problem-solving skills.

# Data Structures
Array
The array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. I'll be implementing basic array operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching.

# Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node. I'll be implementing singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and various operations associated with linked lists.

# Stack
A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. I'll be implementing stack operations like push, pop, and peek.

# Queue
A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. I'll be implementing queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, and front.

# Tree
A tree is a hierarchical data structure with nodes connected by edges. I'll be implementing binary trees, binary search trees, and various tree traversal algorithms.

# Graph
A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. I'll be implementing graph representations and traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

# Hash Table
A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. I'll be implementing basic hash table operations and collision resolution techniques.

# Heap
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure. I'll be implementing the binary heap and heap operations like insert and extract-min.

# Algorithms
Searching
I'll be implementing various searching algorithms like linear search, binary search, and more.

# Sorting
I'll be implementing sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and more.

# Recursion
I'll be exploring recursive algorithms and their applications in problem-solving.

# Dynamic Programming
I'll be implementing dynamic programming algorithms to solve complex problems efficiently.

# Graph Algorithms
I'll be exploring graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, and others.
